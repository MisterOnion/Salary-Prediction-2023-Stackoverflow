A deployable ML model on Webapp for practice

Download Dataset from ( https://survey.stackoverflow.co/ )

Make an Environment for the project

	1. install Anaconda
	- Website download ( https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ )
	- Go to Anaconda(64 bit) folder
	- Select Anaconda Prompt
	- conda init powershell (make env on VSCODE)
	
	What to type in command
	conda create -n ml_prac python=3.10
	conda activate ml_prac
	conda install pandas
	conda install matplotlib
	conda install scikit-learn
	ipython kernel install --user --name=ml_prac (make a kernel)

	jupyter notebook on local machine:
	conda install jupyter
	Select kernel on jupyter notebook in vscode (top right)
	Select jupyter kernel
	Select env name

	Jupyter notebook on web:
	Type jupyter notebook in command
	
	Optional: Find tutorials on vscode own env setup
	$py -3 -m venv ml_prac
	$venv\Scripts\activate

Run ML app with streamlit (localhost)
	1. type in command
		- conda activate ml_prac 
		- streamlit run app.py (pip install streamlit)
		- ctrl + c to stop the server

Deploy using Streamlit
	Prerequitsite: Download git, have a Github account and a Streamlit Account 
	We are hosting it on Streamlit Community Cloud

	- Connect Github account to Streamlit account
	- Upload your code onto Github
	- Add a requirement.txt file (pickle is part of python)
	- Select project from Github to host

Deploy using Docker Container
	Install Docker Desktop beforehand (free for personal use)
	https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

	Build speed may be longer, it depends on internet speed, computer specs
	and project size

	When building, some packages will not be available for docker such as pickle,
	this is prevalent in .yml from anaconda environment. Only use everyday packages like
	numpy, pandas, and matplotlib

	if failed in anyway when deploying, rebuilt it after reading the error

	ls = list files to make sure Dockerfile there


	Anaconda:
		use .yml extension = human-readable data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files
		- conda activate ml_prac
		- conda install -c conda-forge streamlit
		- conda env export --name ml_prac > environment.yml (or other names)
		- Create docker folder (auto-detected by vscode)
		- Create Dockerfile (auto-detected by vscode)
		- Relocate environment.yml (or other names) into docker folder
		- Customize Dockerfile to suit .yml 
		- cd docker in cmd
		- docker build -t AnyNameForIt .

	pyenv:
		use text.file format
		- Create docker folder (auto-detected by vscode)
		- create Dockerfile (auto-detected by vscode)
		- create txt naming convention "requirements.txt" 
		- type in required libraries such as numpy and streamlit
		- relocate "requirements.txt" into Dockerfile folder
		- cd docker
		- docker build -t AnyNameForIt . 
		or 
		- docker build -t AnyNameForIt:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .

Running deployeed docker Container:
	docker run -p 8501:80 YourMLContainerName
	or 
	0.0.0.0: 0.0
